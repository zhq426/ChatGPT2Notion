Step 1: Create an integration
A Notion integration lets you connect information in Notion to other software. To create your own integration:

Visit https://www.notion.com/my-integrations in your browser.
Click the + New integration button.
Name the integration.
Select the capabilities that your integration will have.
Click Submit to create the integration.
On the next page, you’ll find your Notion integration token, also called an API key. You’ll need this token to make requests to the Notion API. To retrieve your token after you leave this page, return to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations and click View integration.
